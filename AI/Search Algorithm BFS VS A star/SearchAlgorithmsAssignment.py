This code compares the performance of the A* code vs the Breadth First Search BFS. The main objectives of this code are:

1. Define a grid map with obstacles, start and goal positions.
2. Implement the A* algorithm and Breadth-First Algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to each goal.
3. Visualize the grid map with A* and BFS paths, goals, and the path taken.
4. Calculate and display the length of each path and the number of explored cells.

The code defines the following functions:

- is_valid(pos, grid): Checks if a position is within the grid boundaries and not an obstacle.
- heuristic(pos, goal): Calculates the Manhattan distance heuristic between two positions.
- a_star(grid, start, goal): Finds the shortest path from the start to a goal using the A* algorithm.
- bfs(grid, start, goal):    Using the Breadth First Search, determine the shortest route between a start point and a destination.
- print_grid(grid_map, paths, goals): Prints the grid map with A* paths, goals, and the path taken.
- print_search_algorithm_results(name, grid_map, path, goal,letter,explored_set):     Print the search algorithm results which includes path length and total explored cells.

The grid map is represented as a NumPy array, 
        '.' represents open cells, 
        'â– ' represents obstacles, 
        'ðŸš©' represents goals,
        letters represent path taken by different goals.

The code iterates through multiple goals, runs the A* and BFS algorithm for each goal, and displays the results, including the path length and the number of explored cells.
